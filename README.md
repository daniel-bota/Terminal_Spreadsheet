A terminal spreadsheet application with limited functionality.

This project served as a base for my other project, [GUI Spreadsheet](https://github.com/daniel-bota/GUI_Spreadsheet).

Implemented formulas:

Reference (=A1)
Range (A1:B5)
SUM (=SUM(arg1;arg2;...))
COUNT (=COUNT(...))
AVERAGE (=AVG(...))
MINIMUM (=MIN(...))
MAXIMUM (=MAX(...))
MODULUS (=MOD(arg1;arg2))
POWER (=POW(arg1;arg2))
LENGTH (=LEN(arg1))
TRIM (=TRIM(arg1))
CONCATENATE (=CONCAT(arg1;arg2))

The table is infinite in both directions.

Table navigation is possible using the arrow keys. Cell data can be input by typing straight away and commited by pressing Enter. Cell contents can be edited by pressing F2.

The window is resizable, and the table will resize accordingly.
